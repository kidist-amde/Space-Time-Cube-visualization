# Space-Time-Cube-visualization
Studies on Human Behavior - Geovisualization of Spatio-temporal data is a very promising topic, especially for social sciences. It is possible to use a space-time cube to reveal activity, travel patterns of different genders, ethnic  subgroups, non-employees, etc. and all the information can be related to urban planning, transportation,location-based services, and many other fields dealing with individual geo-data.In this work, I used the GPS data that describe the movements of 3 subjects and Time diary data , data collected from the 3 subjects through ilog-mobile application..
