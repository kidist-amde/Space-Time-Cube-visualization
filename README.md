# Space-Time-Cube-visualization
## Studies on Human Behaviour - Course  Project
Geovisualization of Spatio-temporal data is a very promising keynote, especially for social sciences. It is possible to use a space-time cube to divulge activity, travel patterns of different genders, racial groups, non-employees, etc., and all the information can be related to urban planning, transportation,location-based services, and many other fields dealing with individual geo-data.In this work, I used the GPS data that describe the movements of 3 subjects and Time-diaray data, data collected from the 3 subjects through the ilog-mobile application.
